    Welcome!

    <div>This is The Keeper of Scores, developed by the Great 
    Nikhil Dabas himself.</div><br />
    <div>Here is a short guide to using this.</div>
    <div>Click the <strong>Events</strong> button on the left
    to see a list of event categories. Clicking on a category
    will display a list of all events. You can then use the
    <strong>Add New</strong> button on the top to add a new event,
    the <strong>Edit</strong> button to change an event name, 
    and the <strong>Delete</strong> button to delete an event.
    You must select an event by clicking on the name before trying
    to edit or delete it.</div>
    <div>The <strong>Scores</strong> button can be used to access
    the results stored in the database. Again, you will be
    presented with a list of categories, and clicking a category
    will show all results in that category. The 
    <strong>Add New</strong>, <strong>Edit</strong>, and
    <strong>Delete</strong> buttons behave as expected.</div>
    <div>You can use the <strong>Reports</strong> button to
    create score cards for any category. Click on
    <strong>Reports</strong>, then select the date range by
    selecting the first and last dates. Clicking on the
    buttons with an ellipsis (<strong>...</strong>) on them will show you a calendar.
    After you have selected the date range for the report,
    clicking on the desired category will instantly generate a
    report.</div>
    <div>Click the <strong>Print...</strong> button to print
    any page. Note that this will start Microsoft Word
    with the current page; you must select Print from the File
    menu to actually print the page.</div>
